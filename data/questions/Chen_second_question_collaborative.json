        "text" : "Agent 86 and Agent 99, both highly skilled spies working for a secret agency, have inﬁltrated enemy territory and have stolen a total of 50.0 kg of highly valuable top secret new material. They need to pass those materials to friendly agents without being noticed by enemies, so they devised a genius plan. \n \n Both of them will disguise as bunjee jumpers jumping together from a bridge. They will secretly tie those materials to their bodies so that the bunjee cord, which you can think of as an ideal spring, will stretch long enough to let them reach the water surface 100.0 m below the bridge, where friendly agents on a disguised ﬁshing kayak will catch them and take the materials from them. \n \n Of course, each of them needs to be heavy enough so that they reach the boat, but if they carry too much of the material and their speed exceeds 6.0 m/s upon crashing into the boat, then they risk sinking the boat! \n \n Agent 99 weights 63.0 kg, and the bungee cord she will be using has a spring constant of 35.0 N/m, and a relaxed length of 25.0 meters. \n \n Now, agent 86 and agent 99 will need to split the weights be­tween the two of them. Ne­go­ti­ate with your part­ner, who has calculated the maximum and minimum weights for Agent 86,  and ﬁnd out how you want to split the weights between the two agents. There are a range of diﬀer­ent ways to split the weights that will en­sure both agents reach the boat, and nei­ther of them crash the boat (round your answer to two decimals in kg). (use g=9.8) \n \n Af­ter you’ve used up all your at­tempts, you will be shown the cor­rect so­lu­tion.",
