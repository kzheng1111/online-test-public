\paragraph{You and your partner are tasked to design a secret weapon for Agent 86 on a secret mission. The secret weapon is a spring gun disguised inside his left shoe (his right shoe containing his famous phone) that can launch a special type of poisonous dart at initial speed 6.5 m/s $\le$ v $\le$ 7.5 m/s, when recoiled for a distance of x cm. Unfortunately, Agent 86 being Agent 86, he handed the two of you a couple of different darts but forgot to tell you the mass of each one. You searched through your lab and found several springs that feels strong enough, but don't know the precise spring constant of each. So the two of you setoff to do some experiments.\newline}
\paragraph{You found a force meter, but it is too weak to reliably measure the spring constant of the springs. However, you measured that when you drag a small block on a smooth track at constant speed, the force needed is n Newtons. You then used each of the springs to launch the same block on the track by compressing the springs for 5cm, and measured how far did the puck go before it stopped. Here's the table of data:}
$$ \begin{array}{l|l:c:r}
         & h    & m     \\ \hline
Dart~1 & 0.64cm & \text{0.001 Newtons} \\ 
Dart~2 & 0.21cm & \text{0.003 Newtons} \\ 
Dart~3 & 0.13cm & \text{0.005 Newtons} \\ \hline
\end{array} $$
\paragraph{Collaborate with your partner, choose a combination of spring/dart that will meet the requirements of Agent 86.}
