\paragraph{Agent 99 has infiltrated enemy territory and has stolen some highly valuable top secret new material. He needed to pass those materials to friendly agents without being noticed by enemies, so he devised a genius plan.\newline}
\paragraph{Agent 99 will disguise as bungee jumpers jumping together from a bridge. he will secretly tie those materials to his body so that the bungee cord, which you can think of as a spring, will stretch long enough to let him reach the water surface, where friendly agents on a disguised fishing kayak will catch him and take the weights from him.
\newline}
\paragraph{Of course, Agent 99 needs to be heavy enough so that they reach the boat, but if he carries too much of the material upon hitting the boat, then they risk sinking the boat!\newline}
\paragraph{The bungee cord he will be using has a spring constant of 35.0 N/m, and length of 25.0 meters. \newline}

\paragraph{What is the maximum amount of weight the agent can carry so that he does not crash the boat?\newline}
