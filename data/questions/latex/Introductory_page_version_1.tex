\paragraph{Welcome to use our online collaborative problem solving system. In this question set, you will solve one physics question with a classmate in your class, and answer three satisfaction survey questions to help us improve the system. You don't know who you have paired with. The only way you can communicate with each other is using the chat box on the left. You can close and open the chat box by clicking the "Messages" on the left bottom. Free feel to say hi to your partner!\newline}

\paragraph{When you are solving the question with your partner, you may or may not see the exact same information, so communicate actively with your partner. Although this is an anonymous practice, try you best and respect your partner.\newline}

\paragraph{When you finish the collaborative question and satisfaction survey questions, push submit to submit the whole question set. You may review the question set after the submission but you are not allowed to change anything. Just close the website.\newline}

\paragraph{Never click the "Give up" botton on the top right, unless your partner disconnected or don't response. After clicking "Give Up", you will be able to connect with a new partner. Don't click it after you submit the question set already. If your webpage accicdently closed or internet disconnected, you can resume by logging in using the id and password you created for yourself.\newline}
