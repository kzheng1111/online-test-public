\paragraph{Agent 86 and Agent 99 have infiltrated enemy territory and have stolen a total of 50.0 kg of highly valuable top secret new material. They need to pass those materials to friendly agents without being noticed by enemies, so they devised a genius plan.\newline}
\paragraph{Both of them will disguise as bunjee jumpers jumping together from a bridge. They will secretly tie those materials to their bodies so that the bunjee cord, which you can think of as a spring, will stretch long enough to let them reach the water surface 100.0 m below, where friendly agents on a disguised fishing kayak will catch them and take the weights from them.\newline}
\paragraph{Of course, each of them needs to be heavy enough so that they reach the boat, but if they carry too much of the material and their speed exceeds 6.0 m/s upon hitting the boat, then they risk sinking the boat!\newline}
\paragraph{Agent 99 weights 63.0 kg, and the bungee cord she will be using has a spring constant of 35.0 N/m, and length of 25.0 meters.\newline}

\paragraph{What is the minimum amount of weight that the agent can carry so that he reaches the boat? \newline}
\paragraph{What is the maximum amount of weight the agent can carry so that he does not crash the boat?\newline}
