\paragraph{You and your partner are tasked to design a secret weapon for Agent 86 on a secret mission. The secret weapon is a spring gun disguised inside his left shoe (his right shoe containing his famous phone) that can launch a special type of poisonous dart at initial speed 6.5 m/s $\le$ v $\le$ 7.5 m/s, when recoiled for a distance of x cm. Unfortunately, Agent 86 being Agent 86, he handed the two of you a couple of different darts but forgot to tell you the mass of each one. You searched through your lab and found several springs that feels strong enough, but don't know the precise spring constant of each. So the two of you setoff to do some experiments.\newline}
\paragraph{
  You found a spring which is labeled with spring constant of k = 5 N/m. However, this spring is too big to be placed into the spring gun, but you realized that you can use it to test the mass of each of the darts. You compressed it by 5cm and measure the distance that it is able to launch the darts straight up into the air. Here is a table for the different measurements:

$$ \begin{array}{l|l:c:r}
         & h    & m     \\ \hline
Dart~1 & 0.64cm & \text{A Newtons} \\ 
Dart~2 & 0.21cm & \text{B Newtons} \\ 
Dart~3 & 0.13cm & \text{C Newtons} \\ \hline
\end{array} $$
