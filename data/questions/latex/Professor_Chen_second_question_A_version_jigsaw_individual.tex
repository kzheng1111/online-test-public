\paragraph{Now please work individually in answering the following question. Do not discuss the solution with your partner. The information is exactly as before, but you are asked to solve for the minimum amount of weight instead of maximum.\newline}
\paragraph{Agent 99 is a female agent played by Anna Hathaway in the recent movie, she has infiltrated enemy territory and has stolen a total of 50.0 kg of highly valuable top secret new material. He needed to pass those materials to friendly agents without being noticed by enemies, so he devised a genius plan.\newline}
\paragraph{Agent 99 will disguise himself as bungee jumper from a bridge. he will secretly tie those materials to his body so that the bungee cord, which you can think of as a spring, will stretch long enough to let him reach the water surface 100.0 m below, where friendly agents on a disguised fishing kayak will catch him and take the weights from him.\newline}
\paragraph{Of course, Agent 99 needs to be heavy enough so that they reach the boat, but if he carries too much of the material and his speed exceeds 6.0 m/s upon hitting the boat, then they risk sinking the boat!\newline}
\paragraph{Agent 99 weights 63.0 kg, and the bungee cord she will be using has a spring constant of 35.0 N/m, and length of 25.0 meters\newline}
\paragraph{What is the minimum amount of weight the agent can carry so that he does not crash the boat?\newline}
