\paragraph{Agent 86 and Agent 99 have inﬁltrated enemy territory and have stolen a total of 50.0 kg of highly valuable top secret new material. They need to pass those materials to friendly agents without being noticed by enemies, so they devised a genius plan.\newline}
\paragraph{Both of them will disguise as bunjee jumpers jumping together from a bridge. They will secretly tie those materials to their bodies so that the bunjee cord, which you can think of as an ideal spring, will stretch long enough to let them reach the water surface 100.0 m below the bridge, where friendly agents on a disguised ﬁshing kayak will catch them and take the materials from them.\newline}
\paragraph{Of course, each of them needs to be heavy enough so that they reach the boat, but if they carry too much of the material and their speed exceeds 6.0 m/s upon hitting the boat, then they risk sinking the boat!\newline}
\paragraph{Agent 86 weights 75.0 kg, and the bungee cord he will be using has a spring constant of 27.0 N/m, and length of 21.0 meters.\newline}
\paragraph{Now, agent 86 and agent 99 will need to split the weights between the two of them. Negotiate with your partner and find out how you want to split the weights. There are a range of different ways to split the weights that will ensure both agents reach the boat, and neither of them crash the boat.\newline}
\paragraph{After you’ve used up all your attempts, you will be shown the correct solution. \newline}
