\paragraph{Note: When solving problems with your partner in CHOPS, you and your partner may have access to different information. You will not always see the same screen content. So be sure to communicate with your partner clearly and respectfully.\newline}
\paragraph{When you ﬁnish the collaborative question and survey, press “Submit” to submit the whole question set.\newline}
\paragraph{If one of you loses your network connection and has to reload the page, you will be able to continue where you left off (sign in again). Just be patient if you see a “collaborator disconnected” notice. However, if your partner still cannot rejoin, you may use the “Terminate” button on the top right. Doing so will allow you to try to reconnect with a new partner. (Don’t use the “Terminate” button for any other reason!)\newline}
