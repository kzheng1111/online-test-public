She will se­cretly tie those ma­te­ri­als to her body so that the bungee cord, which you can think of as a spring, will stretch long enough to let her reach the wa­ter sur­face 100.0 m be­low, where friendly agents on a dis­guised ﬁshing kayak will catch her and take the weights from her. \n \n Of course, Agent 99 needs to be heavy enough so that she reach the boat, but if she car­ries too much of the ma­te­r­ial upon hit­ting the boat and hits the boat too fast, then she risk sink­ing the boat! \n \n Agent 99 weights 63.0 kg, and the bungee cord she will be us­ing has a spring con­stant of 35.0 N/​m, and relaxed length of 25.0 me­ters \n \n What is the min­i­mum amount of weight (in kg) that the agent can carry so that she reaches the boat with zero velocity?
