The correctness of the final answer is determined by both of your inputs. \n \n Based on the information of question 1: \n \n Twenty-two stroke patients performed a maze task. The mean number of trials for success was 14.7 with s = 6.2, the population mean (μ) for this task is 6.5. \n \n You and your partner each need to select one value of either s or number of patients so that the new calculated t is half of the original value. \n \n You are responsible to change the value of s=6.2. \n \n The following formula may be useful: t = (X‾ - μ0) / (s / √n), where X‾ is the sample mean, μ0 represents the population mean, s is the standard deviation of the sample and n stands for the size of the sample.",
